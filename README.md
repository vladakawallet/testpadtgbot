Hello everybody! Here you can see two versions of my telegram bot, developed with Python aiogram 3.3.0.
The first version, originally finished at the end of August 2023 (also with an outdated aiogram version), is posted on the main branch. 
A recently updated version of the bot is on the update1.0 branch, which will be extended with more complex logic and user-friendly features.

## Functionality:
The bot is still only able to receive a strictly structured list of words from the user in order to create an aiogram scene, which throws each word from the list in random order and compares its defined translation with the user's input.
For each word, the user has three attempts. If the user runs out of attempts, the word should appear at the end of a test to be tried again.
There are also some additional features such as a configuration menu (changing user name and language), a tutor command that gives the user a kind of explanation, etc.

Thanks for your attention, I hope you are enjoyed with my idea. 
Another updates are comming soon...
