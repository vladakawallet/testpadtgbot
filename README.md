Hello everyone!
Here you can observe two versions of my Telegram-bot developed with python aiogram 3.3.0
The first version originally completed at the end of August 2023 (also with deprecated aiogram version) is posted on the main branch.
A recently renewed version of bot is posted on the update1.0 branch, which is going to expand with more complex logic and user-friendly features.

## Functionality:
The bot is just able to obtain a strict structured word list from user in order to create an aiogram Scene, which will throw in random order every word from the list and compare its defined translation with an input from user.
Each word gives the user three attempts to procceed a word. If the user runs out of attempts, the word should appear at the end of a test in order to procceed it once more.
There also a few additional features such as a configuration menu (username and language changing), a tutor command, that provides the user with some kind of exlpanation etc.

Thank you for your attention, I hope you are enjoyed with my idea. 
Another updates are comming soon...
